"# Shopping-Cart-System-Java-React"  
# Shopping Cart and Coupons Management System

### Overview  
This system is designed for managing shopping carts, coupons, companies, and customers in an integrated and user-friendly way. It is built using modern technologies including **React** for the frontend, **Spring Boot** for the backend, and **MySQL** as the database.

### Technologies  
- **Frontend:** React.js – a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface  
- **Backend:** Spring Boot – a robust and modular REST API handling business logic  
- **Database:** MySQL – reliable and efficient data storage  

### Key Features  
- Management of companies and customers  
- Create, update, and delete coupons and shopping carts  
- Advanced filtering and querying capabilities  
- Role-based access control (as needed)  
- Secure data transactions stored in MySQL  
- Intuitive and easy-to-use user interface  

### Installation and Running  
1. Ensure MySQL is installed and running locally or on a server  
2. Configure database connection details in Spring Boot’s `application.properties` or `application.yml` file  
3. Run the Spring Boot backend server  
4. Run the React frontend application (e.g., with `npm run dev`)  

### Project Structure  
- **backend/** – Java Spring Boot backend code  
- **frontend/** – React application code  
- **SQL scripts/** – (optional) SQL scripts for database setup  

### Future Improvements  
- Enhanced role-based authorization system  
- Improved user experience (UX) on the frontend  
- Reporting and data analysis features  
- Integration with external payment services
